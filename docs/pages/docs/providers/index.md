Nixpacks currently [supports a bunch of languages](https://github.com/railwayapp/nixpacks/tree/main/src/providers) out of the box with zero config. The default behaviour of the providers can be configured with with various environment variables that are prefixed with `NIXPACKS_`.

For config options, click on a provider in the sidebar.
